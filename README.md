## News

___WARNING!___   _cuGraph-DGL_ will be removed after release 25.06.  We recommend migrating to cuGraph-PyG, which offers the same
functionality along with additional features like support for heterogeneous sampling and a unified API.  The cuGraph team is not planning
any further work in the DGL ecosystem going forward.

___NEW!___   _[nx-cugraph](./python/nx-cugraph/README.md)_, a NetworkX backend that provides GPU acceleration to NetworkX with zero code change.
```
> pip install nx-cugraph-cu11 --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
> export NETWORKX_AUTOMATIC_BACKENDS=cugraph
```
That's it.  NetworkX now leverages cuGraph for accelerated graph algorithms.

[RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai) cuGraph-GNN is a collection of GPU-accelerated plugins that support [DGL](https://dgl.ai), [PyG](https://pyg.org), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), and a variety
of other graph and GNN frameworks.  cuGraph-GNN is built on top of RAPIDS [cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidai/cugraph), leveraging its low-level [pylibcugraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph/python/pylibcugraph) API
and C++ primitives for sampling and other GNN operations ([libcugraph](https://github.com/rapidai/cugraph/python/libcugraph))

cuGraph-GNN is comprised of three subprojects: [cugraph-DGL](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph-gnn/python/cugraph-dgl), [cugraph-PyG](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph-gnn/python/cugraph-pyg), and
[WholeGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph-gnn/python/wholegraph).

* cuGraph-DGL supports the Deep Graph Library (DGL) and offers duck-typed versions of DGL's native graph objects, samplers, and loaders.
** cuGraph-DGL is slated for removal after release 25.06.  We strongly recommend migrating to cuGraph-PyG.
* cuGraph-PyG supports PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and implements PyG's GraphStore, FeatureStore, Loader, and Sampler interfaces.
* WholeGraph supports PyTorch and provides a distributed graph and kv store.  Both cuGraph-DGL and cuGraph-PyG can leverage WholeGraph for even greater scalability.

## <div align="center"><img src="img/rapids_logo.png" width="265px"/></div> Open GPU Data Science <a name="rapids"></a>


The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries aims to enable execution of end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It relies on NVIDIA® CUDA® primitives for low-level compute optimization but exposing that GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.

### Apache Arrow on GPU  <a name="arrow"></a>

The GPU version of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a common API that enables efficient interchange of tabular data between processes running on the GPU. End-to-end computation on the GPU avoids unnecessary copying and converting of data off the GPU, reducing compute time and cost for high-performance analytics common in artificial intelligence workloads. As the name implies, cuDF uses the Apache Arrow columnar data format on the GPU. Currently, a subset of the features in Apache Arrow are supported.
